2 4 5 1 3

# generalizing...

even + even = even
odd  + odd  = even
even + odd  = odd!!! <- potentially problematic

but if we make sure 4 and 5 are at the limit of odds and evens, it works as we saw for n=4 so...

- group all odd numbers wo/ 4
- group all even numbers wo/ 5
- place 4 and 5 in the middle of the 2 groups

(had to look up the solution, wasn't able to identify this pattern myself)
